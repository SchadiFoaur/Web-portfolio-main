        First and for most, what was needed was an idea or a design. How should
        the home page look like? Should I include my face or not? How many
        indexes should the new website be?... So I had this idea of using my
        picture as a background and on top an introductory message would be
        displayed, like welcome to my portfolio or something like that... I
        spent most of the time editing the picture in order to fit into the
        website. After what seemed like eons of editing I was successful in
        making it my background and at the time thought is was okay, but I would
        come to regret it later on. <br />
        Anyways after I thought I was done with the background image I decided
        to move on to the About me section. I had this idea of making it a
        section directly under my main picture, so that it would appear when
        scrolling and everything seemed to work out the outline looked good in
        my head and was gonna be implemented later on.

        Here is an image of the how the new Home page looks like.
