        I was not successful in removing the borders of the Gif, so i just
        decided to blend it with background. I went with a dark theme because it
        looked cleaner and better. I then decided to change the entire layout of
        my homepage after some research on
        <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.1/layout/grid/" target="_blank"
          >Bootstrap's Grid layout </a
        >. I decided on something simple. <br />
        The animated Gif would be on the left and the introductory on the right.
        So i rounded the corners of the Gif and made like an avatar/profile. It
        was fairly easy and simple. Then suddenly the first problem of the day
        came up. The avatar and the content were too close to each other. It was
        easy separating them from each other. After separating the content two
        new problems came up. The contents are now sticking closely to the "Nav
        Bar" and the avatar is not responsive enough. I squeezed my screen and
        realized that the avatar was getting squeezed parallel to the screen
        instead of getting smaller. <br />
        I will spend the entire night learning more about responsiveness and box
        model.
