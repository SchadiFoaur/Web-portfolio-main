          Surprisingly i finished early today. I can still see the sun which is
          a good thing i guess. I worked on the project page and sadly due to
          the lack of materials it is not perfect. However at the end it was not

          I still have no real solution for the footer. However today was a
          fruitful day and i am sure by tomorrow the website will be finished. I
          only came upon small annoying problems, but nothing too big that
          consumed a lot of time. I am currently 95%...

          Although it took around 3 days. I am now officially done with the
          homepage. I made some minor adjustments, color corrections, and some
          simple css animations. After i was finished with the home page i moved

          I studied the box model thoroughly and was able to correct everything.
          The biggest challenge was centering the content in the middle. I never
