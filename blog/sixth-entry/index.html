        Surprisingly i finished early today. I can still see the sun which is a
        good thing i guess. I worked on the project page and sadly due to the
        lack of materials it is not perfect. However at the end it was not hard
        coding it. I made some adjustments, corrected somethings, and improved
        the colors a bit. <br />
        So! With that i am officially done with this website. It was a very fun
        and informative week. I sure learned a lot of things and can certainly
        say that completing online courses is not the same as actually sitting
        and building. It is a very different experience. I'll still come back
        and make some small adjustments, however this will be my last entry! In
        the future when i have some more experience, i'll come back and make
        this website even better. I am sure i would have more projects to add
        and more experience in Web-design.
